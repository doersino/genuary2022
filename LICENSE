(1) The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in

(2) The Software shall not be used, in original or modified form, to generate
    artwork or any kind of derivative work intended for distribution as a
    non-fungible token (an "NFT"). Current implementations of NFTs are
    inherently destructive to the environment; and on a conceptual level, NFTs
    carry little to no practical benefit over conventional means of recording
    provenance and/or ownership of artwork. Read more here:

(3) Condition (2) may be disregarded if the revenue generated by any relevant
    NFTs is wholly spent on bird seed, mealworms, suet, or similar bird food
    items, and said bird food is dispersed around the User's local area for the
    resident birds to feed on, and pictures of said birds eating the provided
    food are shown to the copyright holder noted above.

If any rule of this agreement should be or become inoperative, validity of the
other rules is not affected. The parties will care about replacing the invalid
rule by some valid rule that comes close to the purpose of this agreement.
