#GENUARY2022 №13 – "80x800."

80 by 800 pixels is easy.

So how about 80 by 800 millimeters, using a tiny lil' plotter with a drawing area of only 100 by 160 millimeters? Tricky, but fun to figure out!

How I've plotted this one:

1. Divided the image into 150-millimeter segments,
2. added instructions to draw registration marks outside the image area on either end, then
3. during plotting, aligned the previous segment's left registration mark with the pen tip.

Form factor aside, this drawing is an exploration of the parameter space underlying squircles, everyone's favorite app icon shape slash roundrect alternative. To implement it, I yoinked some math from this excellent post by @ndesmic: https://dev.to/ndesmic/how-to-draw-squircles-and-superellipses-3d14
