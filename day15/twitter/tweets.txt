(on wednesday)
I just plotted the silliest thing (or, rather, a fairly boring thing, but using the silliest "pen" and "paper") for Saturday's #genuary2022 prompt. Stay tuned.


#GENUARY2022 №15 – "Sand."

Pen: A bamboo stick.
Paper: New 400-grit sandpaper.

Utterly pleased that this silly idea ended up working. Reversing my usual format, here's the how-it's-made video – a glamor shot of the finished drawing will be in a reply.
